# Trump_Speeches
This project will examine Donald Trump's word use in all his Presidential speeches, addresses, and appearances from his inauguration (January 20th, 2017) to March 20th, 2018. We hope to predict whether or his not his speech language (sentiment and policy word use) has any impact on the change in his approval rating. We were able collect 1020 speeches which we scraped from the American Presidency Project (http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php). We pulled approval and disapproval ratings from Project 538 (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/).
